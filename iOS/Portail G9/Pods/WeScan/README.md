## Example

## Requirements
- Swift 4.0
- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 9.x


## Installation

### Cocoapods
### Carthage
### Manually
Just download the project, and drag and drop the "WeScan" folder in your project.

## Usage
1. Make sure that your ViewController conforms to the `ImageScannerControllerDelegate` protocol
```swift
class YourViewController: UIViewController, ImageScannerControllerDelegate {

```

2. Implement the delegate functions
```swift
// Somewhere on your ViewController that conforms to ImageScannerControllerDelegate
func imageScannerController(_ scanner: ImageScannerController, didFailWithError error: Error) {
    print(error)
}

func imageScannerController(_ scanner: ImageScannerController, didFinishScanningWithResults results: ImageScannerResults) {
    // Your ViewController is responsible for dismissing the ImageScannerController
    scanner.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}

func imageScannerControllerDidCancel(_ scanner: ImageScannerController) {
    // Your ViewController is responsible for dismissing the ImageScannerController
    scanner.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

3. Simply present the `ImageScannerController` instance on your `ViewController`

```swift
// Somewhere on your ViewController
let scannerVC = ImageScannerController()
scannerVC.imageScannerDelegate = self
self.present(scannerVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
